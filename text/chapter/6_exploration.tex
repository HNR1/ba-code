\section{Further Exploration}
The results of our experiments could be improved by expanding research on the influence of different elements of ToMe's or SD's configuration.\\ 
The larger $768 \times 768$ images benefited noticeably more from token merging than the $512 \times 512$ images, so exploration whether this positive effect further scales up with image size could become relevant.\\
Another aspect we rather briefly touched upon is the selection of \textbf{dst} tokens. ToMe currently only selects one \textbf{dst} token per batch so experimenting with multiple \textbf{dst} tokens per batch and differently sized bacthes might improve performance as well.\\ 
\\
Bolya and Hofmann also mentioned that further improvements could also be achieved by exploring better unmerging strategies or whether proportional attention or key-based similarity are useful for diffusion.
The current unmerge algorithm and token similarity metric are quite naive, so exploring ways to keep some of the information currently lost during the merge process could also greatly benefit the image quality.
