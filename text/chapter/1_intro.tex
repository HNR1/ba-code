\section{Introduction}
In this work, our goal is to speed up an off-the-shelf Sta-
ble Diffusion model without training using ToMe
Token Merging \cite{bolya2023tomesd}.
All experiments were conducted on a high performance computing cluster (hpc) provided by the Heinrich-Heine-Universität Düsseldorf.
"Even at 60\% of tokens merged, ToMe for SD keeps the image the same (most of the time)"
