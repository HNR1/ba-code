\section{Introduction}
In this work, our goal is to speed up an off-the-shelf Stable Diffusion model without training using our implementation of token merging (ToMe) \cite{bolya2023tomesd}.
All experiments were conducted on a high performance computing cluster (hpc) provided by the Heinrich-Heine-Universität Düsseldorf.\\
"Even at 60\% of tokens merged, ToMe for SD keeps the image the same (most of the time)"
