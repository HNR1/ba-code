\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we presented an exploration of the functional quality of Token Merging (ToMe) for Stable Diffusion by \cite{bolya2023tomesd}. ToMe offers accelerated image generation by merging similar tokens to reduce their overall number, notably without training.\\
\\
In this thesis we conducted extensive experiments on images, obtaining speeds and fidelity superior to those of Bolya and Hoffman's default configuration.\\
ToMe has proven itself again as a practical extension to Stable Diffusion to reduce computational resources, cutting image generation time in half while maintaing great image quality.\\
